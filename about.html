      <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
      <br>
      <p> Hello, my name is Joshua Sharp. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I am currently a Junior in the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am studying Entrepreneurship and Marketing with a Minor in Creative Technology and Design. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I spent most of my time outside of pursuing my education on directing CU's Esports Program.
        As the Director of Esports at CU Boulder, I spend a lot of time doing administrative work by overseeing all of the organization's
        team managers and coaches. I also spend time coaching the Valorant Team. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Before becoming the Director of Esports, I actively competed on the Rocket League and Counter-Strike Teams. Now, in my Junior Year, I am actively pursuing competitive Apex Legends. </p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p> As the Director of Esports, I have learned a lot about working
        with and managing people of all different types of personalities.
        I spend most of my working with player talent directly and carrying
        out Administrative, Marketing and Media work within the organization.
        Along with this I spend my weekends setting up esports competition rooms
        and running events such as intramurals and esports tournaments. In the
        future, I am looking to work as a General Manager or Team Manager at a professional
        esports organization. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <button id="Coach">Esports Coach</button>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> As an esports coach, I have experience coaching many titles including Rocket League,
      Valorant, Apex Legends, and Counter-Strike. I transitioned into the coaching role after being
    a competitor in all four of these titles. As a coach I focus mostly on player communication and managing
  player physical and mental health. </p>
