      <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
      <br>
      <p> Hello, my name is Joshua Sharp. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I am currently a Junior in the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am studying Entrepreneurship and Marketing with a Minor in Creative Technology and Design. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I spent most of my time outside of pursuing my education on directing CU's Esports Program.
        As the Director of Esports at CU Boulder, I spend a lot of time doing administrative work by overseeing all of the organization's
        team managers and coaches. I also spend time coaching the Valorant Team. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Before becoming the Director of Esports, I actively competed on the Rocket League and Counter-Strike Teams. Now, in my Junior Year, I am actively pursuing competitive Apex Legends. </p>
