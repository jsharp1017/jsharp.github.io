    <button id="learnMore"> First Date Story of mine. </button>
    <p id="learnParagraph"> I once went out on a first date in High School in which I got setup with a girl who played Volleyball at the recreational center that I worked in.
      I decided that I would take her to one of my favorite local italian restaurants and I thought it was all going to be fine. I hadn't gone on many first dates at that point in my life
      because I had been in a few relationships and hadn't ever experienced a failed attempt at love. I met the girl at the restaurant and immediately as we sat down and starting chatting I realized
      that neither of us were very good at conversation. We both didn't have anything to talk about or anything in common to really connect on. Eventually we ended up leaving the restaurant and never
      talked again. It was quite a strange experience at the time and quite awkward but it helped motivate me to be better at casual conversation. </p>
